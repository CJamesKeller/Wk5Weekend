## Description

***Deprecated***

This is a MEAN stack application that uses a free movie API (omdb) to allow
users to search for their favorite movies and add them to a list of their 
favorites. However, the omdb API has since been modified, so the search functionality
no longer works.

## Installation

Clone this repository, ensure mongoDB is running, and then run `npm install` and
`npm start`.
